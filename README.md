# 3Rails

3Rails is a simple game, where your goal is to dodge obstacles and survive as long as possible.

Made with Ursina engine (Python).

Controls:
You can change rails using up and down arrows or wasd.


Note: This game was quickly rushed, and it is our first time experimenting with Ursina engine. Don't except the code to be good, it just works.
